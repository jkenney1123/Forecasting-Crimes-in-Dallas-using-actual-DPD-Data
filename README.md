# Forecasting-Crimes-in-Dallas-using-actual-DPD-Data
This project aims to forecast crime trends in Dallas County by using Sparse Vector Auto Regressive (SVAR) modeling with a HLAG penalty, which can capture the relationships between different crime types over time. The project compares the crime patterns in TAAG (Targeted Action Area Grids) and non-TAAG areas, which have different levels of criminal activity and policing measures. The project also evaluates the performance of SVAR modeling against other methods, such as traditional VAR and AR models, using the weighted mean forecast error as the metric. The project demonstrates that SVAR modeling can produce the most accurate predictions for both TAAG and non-TAAG areas, and that it can help the Dallas Police Department allocate its resources more effectively and efficiently.
