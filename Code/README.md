This folder contains the R code for my part of the group project, which covers the entire workflow from data cleaning, data transformations, data modeling, and data evaluation. The data evaluation step involved developing a custom model evaluation method to compare the performance of different models on different data sets. The markdown file provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the code, tables, and figures.
